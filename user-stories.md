there's a board and pieces for black and white
there's a scoreboard that shows how many points each player has
there's a log of all the past moves
user clicks piece
user clicks space to move the piece to
if the move isn't possible for any of the following reasons, they receive an error message and can try again
    // the piece cannot make that move
    // the move puts them off the board
    // the space has one of their own pieces on it
    // the path to the space is blocked by any piece
    // the move puts them in check
// if the move takes an opponent's piece...
    // the opponent loses the piece
    // the piece point value is subtracted from the opponents point total
